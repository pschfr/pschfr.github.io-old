This is my website. This iteration started out as [paul-wp](https://ithub.com/pschfr/paul-wp), but I quickly got bored with WordPress and wanted something more challenging.  This Jekyll-powered static site doesn't require any jQuery or other third-party JS, and the index page is 4 HTTP requests, and is ~60kb!

[bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) is used for the responsive grid, the background images come from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), and rest of the magic is custom.
