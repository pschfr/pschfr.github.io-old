This is my website. This iteration started out as [paul-wp](https://ithub.com/pschfr/paul-wp), but I quickly got bored with WordPress and wanted something more challenging.  This Jekyll-powered static site doesn't require any jQuery or other third-party JS, and the index page is 3 HTTP requests, and is ~24kb!

[daneden/Toast](https://github.com/daneden/Toast) is used for the responsive grid, rest of the magic is custom.
