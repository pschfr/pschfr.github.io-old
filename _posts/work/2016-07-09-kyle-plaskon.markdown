Long description of this site I built for my good friend Kyle Plaskon. Perhaps a gallery? Should I only show like an excerpt and link readers to a full-fledged case study, including sketches and in-development screenshots? I would like to show my currently in development websites, perhaps I should just do it with a category or tag? We will find out later on Dragonball Z!
