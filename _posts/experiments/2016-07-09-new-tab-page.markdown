For an aspiring developer, one of the best ways to find something to develop is to scratch your own itch. I was disappointed with how simple the New Tab page was in Google Chrome, so I built a more visually appealing and useful one. Every time I open a new tab, I’m greeted with a colorful linear gradient, the weather, a nice quote, and my bookmarks! It also has keyboard navigation, which I go into more detail at here on it’s [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/pschfr/Start)
